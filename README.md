# kampyle-live-demobuilder
An advanced demo-builder for the Kampyle sales team.    This app allowed a non-technical salesperson to generate a live, fully-customized product demonstration website which fully replicated the prospect's own website and integrated the Kampyle engagement and feedback system.   Importantly, the resulting site was fully functional, included full branding (with the prospect's logo, colors etc) and crucially could be accessed by a unique URL which could be sent and shared.
